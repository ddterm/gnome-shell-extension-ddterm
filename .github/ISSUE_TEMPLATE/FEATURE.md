<!--

Pull requests are preferred to feature requests :)

Keeping up with new GNOME releases and fixing bugs already take a lot of time,
so new features are rarely implemented. Nevertheless, you could leave a feature
request and maybe someone else will implement it sometime.

If you have time and motivation to try to implement the feature, see
docs/CONTRIBUTING.md
